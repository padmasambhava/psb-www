The centre is run by a small group of 
dedicated individuals. Set up as an 
unincorporated charitable organisation in 1995.

From the beginning the underlying philosophy has been one of 
seva and karma yoga or selfless service. 
This is the core practice of the members of Padma.

## Aims and Objectives

The detailed aims and objectives defined in 
the constitution are currently under review, 
prior to charity registration, and will 
be posted when the approval process has been completed. 

Here are the main aims:-
- To promote, foster and conduct research in to the effects of Yoga.
- To provide yoga classes for the community by teachers trained in 
the "Satyananda Yoga" tradition regardless of age, 
sex, race or religious beliefs (or lack thereof).
To present yoga workshops, seminars and retreats.
To establish a residential centre where the 
yogic lifestyle can be more fully experienced.

## What Padma provides to students

Regular yoga classes in the "Satyananda Yoga" tradition and 
a variety of workshops and retreats with concessionary rates for 
those in need.
A library containing books and videos on yoga and 
related subjects for loan.
A retail outlet for yoga textbooks and products required by 
students to facilitate their practice.
An opportunity to work in the spirit of seva, either by 
doing karma yoga at the centre, by working on one of its projects or 
by helping other charitable works going on elsewhere.
A website updating yoga activities, providing links to 
other related sites and publication of articles about 
different aspects of yoga posted by contributors worldwide.

## The teachers

All regular class teachers are trained in 
the "Satyananda Yoga" tradition.
The resident teachers and the members of the committee receive 
no remuneration or material reward for running the centre. 
The residents provide for their own living expenses through 
external work. Padma does pay its teachers to teach classes, 
workshops and retreats.

The benefits of this approuch
We are able to teach classes and hold events irrespective of 
whether they are financially viable independently as profits from 
certain courses can be used to subsidise others without the 
usual requirements that other organisations and centres may have to 
break even or make a profit. 
This allows us to hold events that will be of the most benefit 
to the students attending.
We are able to work in a spirit of seva considering the 
needs of others as a priority when embarking on any project.

Funds for other work
Funds are collected for Sivananda Math, an Indian charity that 
fosters and aids developing local communities in Bihar. 
A clear description of their activities can be seen on Here (cache)
You may support this fund either by attendance on 
an event held specifically in aid of Sivananda Math, 
purchase of the "Yoga Magazine" or by making a donation.

These funds have no administrative expenses applied 
and this is the policy of choice for the future also.
