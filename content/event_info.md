Classes
At the Centre The centre teaches by the term 
thus ensuring that classes are able to progress systematically.

All classes include a blend of 
- Asana physical postures, 
- Pranayama breathing practices, 
- Yoga Nidra deep relaxation 
- Meditation. 

Classes are small in numbers ensuring individual attention.

The Teachers The classes are presented by 
experienced teachers who have trained with the 
Bihar School of Yoga and/or Satyananda Yoga centres in the UK 
and holding accredited BWY teaching diplomas. 
As well as giving classes and workshops under 
Padma's scheduled programme our teachers also teach 
other classes and workshops. Please enquire at the centre for details.

What you need Loose comfortable clothing, a shawl 
or blanket to cover the body during the relaxation Yoga Nidra. 
Please refrain from taking a full meal less than 
an hour before class. The yoga room is warm and carpeted 
so mats are not needed.

Other Classes We also provide individual classes and 
the teachers associated with the center also teach at other venues.

Day Workshops
A day workshop is a wonderful way to further your understanding 
of a particular aspect of yoga. They are popular with yoga students 
& teachers. Usually consisting of both theory & practice 
they are presented by experienced yoga teachers who have 
generally specialised in the chosen subject. Previous Workshop Topics

Retreats
These enable one to explore the subtler aspects of yoga away 
from everyday distractions. Experienced Satyananda Yoga teachers 
run all retreats on specific subjects. On retreat you are able 
to explore the deeper essence of yoga with daily Asana, Pranayama, 
Meditation, lectures, walks in nature & excellent vegetarian food.

Venues
The Llandeilo Centre Many of the workshops are run at the centre 
in Llandeilo. The days usually start at 10.00am and finish 
at 4.00pm. We encourage students to arrive early to have time to 
refresh and settle and to bring food for a shared lunch. 
Group size is limited to a maximum of ten so be sure to 
book well in advance to ensure a place.

Other Venues Workshops are also held at other venues where 
the enviornment is conjusive to the more meditative subjects. 
Having access to specialised communications equipment and 
the possibility of larger group sizes, this enables us to 
present key world teachers.
Please reserve a place well in advance to avoid disapointment.
